Welcome to Teczter!

This is a manual regression testing tool. Users can create tests, execute tests, assign tests to others and monitor test states. The aim of this project is to create a free and simple testing tool, to replace the use of pricey alternatives.

In order to run this project locally, set the relevant values in appsettings and create the database using the latest migration (You can do this by running 'update-database' from the Package Manage Console).
