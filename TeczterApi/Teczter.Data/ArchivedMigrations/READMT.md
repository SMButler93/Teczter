# EF Core Migration Archive

## Why this folder exists:

This folder contains EF core migrations from when a code first approach was used.

As of 16/05/2025, the project has transitioned over to using an SSDT project for schema management.


## What to know;

- DO NOT USE EF MIGRATIONS ANYMORE. 
- All schema changes should be made in the SSDT project and deployed via DACPAC
